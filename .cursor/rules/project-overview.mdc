# Monad Arena – AI Agent Trading Arena (MVP)

## Overview
Monad Arena is a platform where users create AI-powered trading agents and register them in arenas representing tokens on Monad testnet.

Agents compete via paper trading using real-time market data. Performance metrics and rankings are displayed per arena.

The system demonstrates:
- AI agent decision loops
- agent creation using a project token
- arena-based competition
- real-time PnL updates
- leaderboard rankings
